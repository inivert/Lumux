# Deployment Report

## Initial Issues
1. The initial deployment failed due to Prisma generate not being executed properly
2. Node.js version compatibility issues needed to be addressed
3. Build command sequence needed proper organization

## Solution Steps

1. **Package.json Modifications**:
   ```json
   {
     "scripts": {
       "build": "next build",
       "postinstall": "prisma generate"
     }
   }
   ```
   - Added `postinstall` script to handle Prisma generation automatically
   - Simplified build command to focus on Next.js build

2. **Vercel.json Configuration**:
   ```json
   {
     "version": 2,
     "buildCommand": "npm run build",
     "devCommand": "npm run dev",
     "installCommand": "npm install --legacy-peer-deps",
     "env": {
       "NODE_ENV": "development"
     }
   }
   ```
   - Set explicit build and install commands
   - Used `--legacy-peer-deps` to handle dependency conflicts
   - Set environment to development mode

3. **Build Process Flow**:
   1. `npm install --legacy-peer-deps` (handles dependencies)
   2. `prisma generate` (runs automatically via postinstall)
   3. `next build` (builds the application)

4. **Key Decisions**:
   - Used postinstall hook for Prisma instead of build command
   - Kept development environment for initial deployment
   - Implemented proper dependency installation flags

## Successful Deployment
- Preview URL: https://lumux-mleg96afd-carlos-projects-595c805f.vercel.app
- Build completed successfully
- All Next.js routes compiled properly
- Development environment configured correctly

## Additional Safeguards
- Updated .gitignore to exclude Vercel-specific files
- Added comprehensive patterns for various development artifacts
- Ensured sensitive directories and files are not tracked

## Next Steps Available
- Deploy to production using `vercel --prod`
- Configure additional environment variables if needed
- Set up custom domains if required

## CLI Interaction Choices
When deploying with Vercel CLI, these were the chosen options:
1. Set up and deploy: `yes`
2. Which scope: Selected personal scope
3. Link to existing project: `no`
4. Project name: `lumux`
5. Directory: `./` (root directory)
6. Modified settings: `no` (used auto-detected Next.js settings)

## Environment Variables Required
For a successful deployment, ensure these environment variables are set in Vercel:
- `DATABASE_URL` - For Prisma database connection
- `NEXTAUTH_URL` - For authentication
- `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` - For authentication security
- `SITE_NAME` - For site configuration
- Additional variables based on enabled integrations
